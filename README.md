How online stores can help customers to buy the right product from their millions of
products,so that online retailers can retain the customer from going elsewhere and see
yearly increase in their average order value. Build a recommendation system so that
customers can get the right product with personalized info.
Online stores show millions of products to the customer from their catalog. Choosing the
correct product for their needs is becoming difficult because of so much information.Since
customers are more likely to buy based on personalized recommendations, management
has decided to go for a recommendation system so that they can retain the customer and
hence increase yearly product sales.
Data Source
In this project recommendation model is built based on electronics products of Amazon,
based on the ratings.
The dataset here is taken from the below website.
Source - Amazon Reviews data (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html) The
repository has several datasets. For this case study, I am using the Electronics dataset.
Sample review dataset:
This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata
(descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also
viewed/also bought graphs). And has 1689188 records.
"reviewerID": "A2SUAM1J3GNN3B",
"asin": "0000013714",
"reviewerName": "J. McDonald",
"helpful": [2, 3],
"reviewText": "I bought this for my husband who plays the piano. He is having a wonderful
time playing these old hymns. The music is at times hard to read because we think the
book was published for singing from more than playing from. Great purchase though!",
"overall": 5.0,
"summary": "Heavenly Highway Hymns",
"unixReviewTime": 1252800000,
"reviewTime": "09 13, 2009"
Data set had 1m+ rows and with no null values. out of 17 features only 4 features
viz.,'reviewerId', 'productId', 'ratings','timestamp' are considered.Various types of
distribution are looked at to get a better understanding of data.
Summary of data set
Number of reviews: 1365131
Number of unique reviewers = 1036895
Number of unique products = 35192
Average rating score: 4.046
Insights
Product Ratings:
Products were rated with discrete numbers 1,2,3,4,5. Most of the reviews rated 5. Here is
the actual numbers
Single Reviewer rated more than 50 times. This shows customers are buying many products
from this store. Here is the top 5 number of times the reviewer has given the ratings.
Popular products
The top 5 most popular product are -
B007WTAJTO with ratings 14162
B0019EHU8G with ratings 12274
B003ELYQGG with ratings 11611
B0012S4APK with ratings 5606
B0001FTVEK with ratings 5324
Here is the distribution
Total Review Number based on years -
Number of reviews was maximum in the year 2013.Looks there were hardly ratings done on
products till 2002 and slowly started from 2003.
2013 with ratings 513513
2014 with ratings 346501
2012 with ratings 223490
2011 with ratings 128834
2010 with ratings 67371
Unique customer per year:
2010 with customer 61782
2011 with customer 115009
2012 with customer 192277
2013 with customer 414734
2014 with customer 288186
There were a total of 1151618 unique customers visited between 1999 to 2014. Year 2013
has seen the maximum number. Here is the visual distribution
Unique Products per year
2010 has seen 7002 products
2011 has seen 11177 products
2012 has seen 17387 products
2013 has seen 26257 products
2014 has seen 24322 products
2013 has seen the more products.From the plot looks there were not many products till
2005.
From 1999 to 2004, not many reviews were given, maybe customers were buying less
product, or reviews and ratings were not that significant for product purchase.
Model Selection :-

There are a lot of different packages available to build a recommender system. For this one,
I'm using the Surprise package. Surprise has many different algorithms built in.Itprovides
various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood
methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also,
various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearsonâ€¦) are built-in.
In this case, I need to load in a custom dataset to use with Surprise. According to the
documentation, we need to make sure our data frame has three columns: the user ids, the
item ids, and the ratings. Additionally, we'll need to specify the rating scale. In our case,
users have used the ratings discretely from 1 to 5.
I'm also going to split the data into training and testing data using the Surprise package
With the Surprise library, I used below algorithms
BaselineOnly:Algorithm predicting the baseline estimate for a given user and item.
KNNBaseline:A basic collaborative filtering algorithm taking into account a baseline rating.
NMF:A collaborative filtering algorithm based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization.
Co-clustering:A collaborative filtering algorithm based on co-clustering.
SVD:When baselines are not used, this is equivalent to Probabilistic Matrix Factorization, it is
as popularized by Simon Funk during the Netflix Prize
Metrics used are rmse and mae. And here is the result.
BaselineOnly algorithm has given the best rmse. So I used this model to get the product
recommendation based on ratings.
Top 10 best predictions
The above are the top 10 best Predictions. The product 'B000HGHMF8','B000IF51UQ' and
'B0028E1E2Y' are rated best with ratings 4.
Top 10 worst predictions
Cross checking with productId B007WTAJTO, this has predicted rating 4.89 and 10k
reviewers rated this.
Conclusion:
There are many ways to build and improve this recommender system. I couldn't use k-NN
algorithms from the Surprise package, as it needs more memory, nor could I complete it on
google colab. Using more tuned parameters I did some basic cross validation to select the
best parameters. To improve the recommendations, tune these parameters and make sure
that the algorithm is serving the best recommendations possible with the data available.
